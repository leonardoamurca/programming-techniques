> This repo aims to make explicit the analysis of some of the algorithms worked in class for the discipline of Project and Analysis of Algorithms. The algorithms are: The Knightâ€™s tour problem, the Longest Increasing Subsequence, the Matrix Chain Multiplication, the change problem and the Knapsack Problem. These algorithms use the following techniques: Greedy Algorithms, Programming and Backtracking.
